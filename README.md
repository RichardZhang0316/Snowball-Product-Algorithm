## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

Over the past few years, Snowball products have seen a surge in their development in China, reaching an unprecedented scale of 500 billion yuan. Picture this, it's three years ago and a brokerage is planning to issue a Snowball product linked to the CSI 500 Index. The product structure for the Snowball is set to 75~102, promising a knock-out coupon rate of 20% per annum, and a fundraising goal set at 200 million yuan. This document discusses an algorithm which simulates the annualized retained earnings of the brokerage in three possible situations: 

1. Knock-out
2. Non-knock-in, non-knock-out
3. Knock-in, non-knock-out

## About the CSI 500 Index <a name="csi-500-index"></a>

The **CSI 500 Index** (China Securities Index 500) is a prominent stock market index maintained by the China Securities Index Company (CSIC). This index provides a snapshot of the performance of small-cap stocks on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges.

## Algorithm Overview <a name="algorithm-overview"></a>

The Python script described here reads an Excel file containing date and index values, representing the CSI 500 index. The purpose of this script is to simulate the investment process of a Snowball product over a period of time under various conditions for buying and selling shares based on the index value.

The script is designed to calculate different scenarios such as the occurrence of a knock-in event, a knock-out event, or neither. Furthermore, it manages different levels of holding assets based on the drop in price relative to the initial price.

At the end of the simulation, the script determines the broker's retained annualized return under different scenarios. The annualized return is calculated based on the broker's profit, the principal amount, and the length of the investment period.

## Conclusion <a name="conclusion"></a>

This Snowball Product Algorithm offers a detailed and comprehensive solution for simulating and predicting the performance of financial instruments linked to the CSI 500 index. The purpose of this project is to offer a practical and valuable tool for financial engineers, risk managers, and anyone else interested in the vibrant field of financial technology.
