# Snowball-Product-Algorithm
This is an algorithm of a snowball product targeting at the CSI index designed by me.
Introduction: In recent years, the Snowball product has developed rapidly in China, with a scale reaching as much as 500 billion. Suppose today was three years ago, and a brokerage wanted to issue a Snowball product linked to the CSI 500 Index.

Set the Snowball product structure type to 75~102, with a knock-out coupon rate of 20% per annum, and a fundraising amount of 200 million yuan.

This algorithm calculates the annualized retained earnings of the broker under the three situations of knock-out, non-knock-in non-knock-out, and knock-in non-knock-out.
